# Task-2--Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Titanic-Dataset
I used the Titanic dataset to work on an EDA project during my internship. The objective was to examine passenger data in order to identify trends and variables that affect survival rates. In order to comprehend the connections between variables like age, gender, class, fare and embarkation point, I cleaned, transformed and visualized the data.

Situation
It was challenging to find survival patterns in the Titanic dataset because of missing values, inconsistent data types and unstructured information.

Task
My responsibilities included cleaning the dataset, investigating the relationships between survival and statistics and clearly visualizing the results.

Action
I created descriptive statistics, converted categorical features, and handled missing values. I investigated survival by gender, class, age and family size using Matplotlib, Python, Pandas and Seaborn. To find important insights, I created distribution charts, heatmaps and bar plots.

Result
Women, children, and first-class passengers had the highest survival rates, according to the analysis, which also showed distinct socioeconomic and demographic trends. My proficiency in data cleaning, EDA, and visual storytelling was enhanced by this project; I now use these abilities to solve actual business issues.
